At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6)


We first load the file

```{r read_GDP_data, eval=TRUE}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("Data","Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

Then, we tidy the data. As it is in wide format, we make it into long, tidy format.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data
skim(UN_GDP_data)



tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>%
                  pivot_longer(cols=4:51,names_to="Year",values_to = "Expenditure") %>%
                  mutate (Expenditure = Expenditure / 1000000000 ) %>%
                  mutate(
                        IndicatorName = case_when(
                        IndicatorName == "Final consumption expenditure" ~ "FCI",
                        IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household Expenditure",
                        IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government Expenditure",

Using the [Expenditure method](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenditure-method.asp) equation for GDP = Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*) + Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*) + Government Expenditure (G) + Net Exports (exports - imports), we can calculate the GDP from the individual indicators in the data frame, and compare that to the GDP given. 

We find the % difference between the calculated GDP and the given GDP figures included in the dataframe

    #First, we calculate the GDP as per the equation. 
      #We sum over expenditures that are NOT (Imports or GDP), for a given year and country

    ) %>%

tidy_GDP_data_NK <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country == "D.P.R. of Korea", 
         IndicatorName %in% c("Exports",
                            "Imports",
                            "Gross capital formation",
                            "Government Expenditure",
                            "Household Expenditure",
                            "GDP")
         ) %>% 
  arrange(Year)

tidy_GDP_data_NK


```

The first thing that pops out when inspecting the data frame is that D.P.R. of Korea seems to have negative GDP according to our calculation! Upon further inspection, as can be seen in the second dataframe produced, we can see that not all the data we need to calculate the GDP using the formula is available to us for D.P.R. of Korea. This explains the strange numbers we found.

For the rest of the countries and years, it seems some percentage differences are small and almost negligible, others take values between 1-10% difference, and few take values greater than that. In general, the differences between the different percentages varies significantly from country to country and from year to year.

**What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? **

The last chart breaks down the GDP of Germany, India, and the United States. It maps how much Government Expenditure, Gross Capital Formation, Net Exports, and Household Expenditure have contributed to total GDP over the years.

For Germany, their Household expenditure has dipped in its contribution to aggregate GDP as has Gross Capital Formation. Their Government Expenditure has stayed relatively the same in terms of contribution. However, Net Exports has increased signficantly. The increase can primarily be seen beginninng in the 1990s into the 2000s. I believe a plausible explanation for this is the end of the Soviet Union and the reunification between East and West Germany. As the economy moved away from communism and opened up economic borders, the economy opened up and the country's net exports increased significantly.

For India, Household Expenditure has decreased its contribution into GDP significantly, while Government Expenditure and Net Exports (for the most part) have stayed the same. Over the past 20 years, Gross Capital Formation has heavily increased its contribution to aggregate GDP.I think a plausible explanation for this trend can be seen through the economic policies of the government. In the 1970s and 1980s, the government of India's economic policies were not favoured towards trading or pursuing foreign relations (influenced by close relations with the Soviet Union). Since the 1990s into the 2000s, the government has ditched those past policies in favour of more open borders, trade agreements, and globalisation. This has resulted in a boom of foreign investment into the region ("oursourcing") as well as better domestic business growth, which is seen through gross capital formation's increased contribution. For household expenditure, their overall figures might be the same, but the contribution has been coming down due to increases in the total aggregate gdp from other sources. One could also argue that their household contribution to GDP is coming down to what other countries around the world see with their GDP.

For the United States, Net Exports and Government Expenditure have been slowly decreasing, while Household Expenditure and Gross Capital Formation have slighty increased. I think these trends make sense given their economy's switch away from manufacturing to a more service-oriented, which means their net exports have decreased. Further, their economy has been strong (on average) for the past 50 years and their households (again on average) some of the wealthiest in the world, which is why these two factors have continued to increase their contribution towards GDP.
