Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions.

The question is, is this a self-fulfilling prophecy or not? The wonderful and beautfiul short story below, illustrates what we mean by that:

```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static","img","yield_curve_parable.jpg"))
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten.

First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# TurnFRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# recast myvars as a factor for when we later facet by myvars, so that the plot facets/appear in the right order
myvars <- factor(myvars, levels = myvars)


# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers, var=myvars, maturity=maturity)

# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}
#joining two dataframes, df and mylookup, from the left. 
yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 

#printing the new dataframe
yield_curve

#skimmming this dataframe to extract useful info
skim(yield_curve)
```

## Plotting the yield curve

**According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?**


Under normal circumstances, the yield curve has an arching, upward slope because bond investors expect to be compensated more for taking on the added risk of owning bonds with longer maturities. When yields further out on the curve are substantially higher than those near the front, the curve is referred to as steep. So a 30-year bond will deliver a much higher yield than a 2-year note. When the gap, or “spread”, is narrow, it is referred to as a flat curve. In that situation, a 10-year note, for instance, may offer only a modestly higher yield than a 3-year note. On rare occasions, some or all of the yield curve ceases to be upward sloping. This occurs when shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones and is called an inversion. While various economic or market commentators may focus on different parts of the yield curve, any inversion of the yield curve tells the same story: An expectation of weaker growth in the near future. Still, while a recession may be likely to follow an inversion, the timing is uncertain, and loose monetary policy globally could result in any downturn taking longer to materialize. The data shows that the spread between the 3month and the 10y bond diminishes before a recession. Since 1999, the yield on the 3month bonds exceeded the yield on the 10 year bonds 3 time: In 2001, 2007, and 2019.




Finally, we would like to reproduce the following plot

*Sample graph:*
```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static","images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```
We proceed in three steps:

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

*Our Result:*
```{r, final_graph_challenge1}
