Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. We will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

```{r}
data(yrbss) #loads data
glimpse(yrbss) #glimpses data
skimr::skim(yrbss) #Using function skim from skimr package to find missing values
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

We first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. 

**Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights.** 

```{r, eda_on_weight}
#find summary statistics
summary(yrbss) 


##plot

#plot showing distribution of weights in the data
ggplot(yrbss, aes (weight) ) +

  #make it a histogram
  geom_histogram(bidwidth = 5) +
  
  #label the plot
  labs(
    title = "The Average Weight of US High Schoolers is 68kg",
    subtitle = "Distribution of Weight", 
    x = "Weight (kg)", 
    y = "", 
    caption = "Source: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.html"
    ) +
  
  #choose theme_wsj  
  theme_wsj() + 
  
  #customizing our graph so it looks nice 
  theme(
    
    #specify title size and vertical position
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 1),
    
    #specify subtitle size
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),
    
    #specify x-axis title size and vertical position
    axis.title.x = element_text(size=10, vjust = -1),
    
    #specify x-axis ticks size
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    
    #specify y-axis ticks size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    
    #specify caption text size and vertical position
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, vjust = -4)
    )

```

**How many observations are we missing weights from?**

There are 1004 values missing for weight which we can have found by using the skim function on the yrbss dataframe.




Next, we consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

**Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?**

```{r, Active_three_or_more_per_week_CI}
#define new dataframe yrbss2 which takes yrbss as an input to be manipulated. 
yrbss2 <- yrbss %>% 
  
  #Add new column: entry is 'yes' if student is physically active for 3 or more days a week, and 'no' otherwise.
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))



##create new dataframe for propotion and count of students who exercise 3 days or more, and those who don't

#defining the new dataframe
yrbss_3 <- yrbss2 %>% 
  
#filter out all rows for which the entry of the physical_3plus column is NA
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  
#group by whether high schooler is physically active 3 or more days, or not 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  
#Collapse dataframe tocount the number of students that are physically active three days or more, and the number of students that aren't
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 

#add column of proportions called prop
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count))

#print the table to make sure it all works 
yrbss_3 



##confidence intervals 

#defining a function: input a proportion x and a total count/total number of trials y; outputs the standard deviation (binomial distribution)
sd_prop <- function(x,y) sqrt(x*(1-x)/y) 

#defining a function: input a proportion x, a total count/total number of trials y, and a percentile z; outputs the confidence limit for that percentile. 
CI <- function(x,y,z) x + qnorm(z)*sd_prop(x,y)

#defining the total number of students in physical_3plus
sum_sample <- sum(yrbss_3$count)

#formatting the proportions in percentages for later use
percentage <- scales::percent(yrbss_3$prop)


#defining a new dataframe for the confidence intervals
yrbss_ci <- yrbss_3 %>%
  mutate(
                
  #find the standard deviation using the function sd_prop() defined above
  SD = sd_prop(prop, sum_sample), 
                     
  #find the lower 95% confidence interval limit for our proportions using the function CI() defined above         
  CI_low = CI(prop, sum_sample, 0.025), 
  
  #find the higher 95% CI limit  
  CI_high = CI(prop, sum_sample, 0.975), 
  
  #find the lower 95% CI limit in terms of absolute counts
  CI_low_abs = CI_low*sum_sample, 
  
  #find the higher 95% CI limit in terms of absolute counts
  CI_high_abs = CI_high*sum_sample
  )

#print the dataframe to read off the values
yrbss_ci



##plot the counts with the 95% CIs to get a nice visualisation of the data

#Plot showing the number of students who exercise 3 or more times a week, and how many don't
yrbss_ci_plot <- yrbss_ci %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = physical_3plus, y = count, fill = physical_3plus)) +
  
  #Adding labels
  labs(
    title = "Most Students Exercise 3 or More Times per Week",
    subtitle = "According to Data from this Survey",
    x = "Exercise three or more times a week?",
    y = "Number of Students From Survey"
  ) +
  
  #plot a bar (column) graph, don't show the legend for the fill = physical_3plus
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  
  #plot the error bars using the CI calculated above
  geom_errorbar(width=0.2, aes(ymin=CI_low_abs, ymax=CI_high_abs)) +
  
  #use theme wsj cause it looks nice, and scale the size of the text
  theme_wsj() +
  
  #customising our graph so it looks nice. 
  #In addition, by default, axis titles don't appear in theme_wsj plots
  #thus, must add new theme element to manually override that
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=12),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10) 
    ) +
  
  #add proportions as percentages for clarity
  geom_text(aes(label = percentage, vjust = -0.5, hjust = 3)) 

#show the plot
yrbss_ci_plot

```

The 95% Confidence Intervals for the proportion of high schoolers that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week ranges from 4298 to 4510 high schoolers. As can be seen on the plot, this is quite a narrow confidence interval.
  
**Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?**

```{r, boxplot}
#filtering out the NAs in the physical_3plus column
yrbss_no_NA <- yrbss2 %>% 
              filter(!is.na(physical_3plus))



#graph of weight against whether students exercise 3 or more times a week
ggplot(yrbss_no_NA, aes (x=physical_3plus, y=weight)) +
  
#define it as a boxplot
  geom_boxplot() +
  
#Adding labels
  labs(title = "The Relationship between Weight and Exercise",
       subtitle = "Boxplot of Physical Activity vs. Weight for US Highschoolers", 
       x = "Weight", 
       y = "Count", 
       caption = "Source: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.html") +
  
#choosing wall street journal theme and scaling all text
  theme_wsj(base_size = 9)

```
We expected to see that students who were more physically active, weigh less on average than students who are less physically active. However, what we see on the boxplot seems to be the opposite. Students who exercise three or more times a week (yes) are heavier on average, than students who do not (no). This may be because young teenagers are not yet fully mature yet and are still developing physically. 


## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test.


```{r, CI_BOXPLOT}

#create dataframe with summary statistics about student relationship between weight and exercise per week

yrbss2 %>%
  
  #group by whether students exercise 3 or more times a day or not (respectively 'yes' and 'no')
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  
  #filter out the rows for which the physical_3plus column has value NA 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  
  #fcalculate summary statistics
  summarise(
            #mean weight 
            mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            
            #standard deviation of weight data for each group (yes or no to physical_3plus)
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            
            #the number of students which exercise 3 or more times a week and the number of students who don't
            count = n(),
            
            #standard error of weight data for each group
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            
            #t value for 95% percentile (Student's t distribution since sample)
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            
            #margin of error for 95% CI
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            
            #lower 95% CI
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            
            #upper 95% CI
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
           )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

**Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least 3 times a week and those who don’t.**

* Null Hypothesis: Mean weights are equal between the two groups
* Alternative Hypothesis : Mean weights are different between the two groups

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss2)
```

## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Here we use the infer package to see whether we can reject the null hypothesis or not.

First, we initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}

obs_diff <- yrbss2 %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

obs_diff

```


After we have initialized the test, we must simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r}

#simulating the null distribution
null_dist <- yrbss2 %>%
  
  #specify the two variables we're investigating
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  #null hypothesis
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  #generate/simulate null hypothesis
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  #calculate the difference in means
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}

#plotting the null distribution
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_wsj(base_size = 9) +
  labs(title = "Null Distribution for Mean weights",
       subtitle = "Using the Infer Package", 
       x = "", 
       y = "Count")
 

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`.

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided") +
  theme_wsj(base_size = 8) +
    labs(title = "Null Distribution for Mean weights with p-value",
       subtitle = "Using the Infer Package", 
       x = "", 
       y = "Count")
  

null_dist %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided") 

```

We can clearly see, both from the t-test and from using the infer package, that we may reject the null hypothesis. Both gives p-values which are essentially zero. Since this is less than 5%, we can reject the null hypothesis: the mean weights of people which exercise 3 or more times a week vs. those who do not, are not the same.
